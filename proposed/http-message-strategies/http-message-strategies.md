# HTTP Message Strategies

This document describes extensible interfaces for common strategies to process
HTTP Messages defined by [PSR-7](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/).

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

The final implementations MAY decorate the objects and methods with more
functionality than the one proposed but they MUST implement the indicated
interfaces/functionality.
